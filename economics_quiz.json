        {
            "question": "What does the intersection of the supply and demand curves represent?",
            "options": [
                "Market disequilibrium",
                "Market equilibrium",
                "Excess supply",
                "Excess demand"
            ],
            "correct_answer": "Market equilibrium",
            "explanation": "The intersection of the supply and demand curves is the point at which the quantity supplied equals the quantity demanded, known as market equilibrium."
        },
        {
            "question": "What can cause a shift in the demand curve?",
            "options": [
                "Change in consumer taste",
                "Price of goods",
                "Market equilibrium",
                "Decrease in income"
            ],
            "correct_answer": "Change in consumer taste",
            "explanation": "Factors that shift the demand curve include changes in consumer tastes, prices of substitutes or complements, and changes in income, among others."
        },
        {
            "question": "What is the price elasticity of demand in the case of perfectly inelastic demand?",
            "options": [
                "Zero",
                "Infinity",
                "-1",
                "Greater than 1"
            ],
            "correct_answer": "Zero",
            "explanation": "In the case of perfectly inelastic demand, the quantity demanded does not change with a change in price, resulting in a price elasticity of zero."
        },
        {
            "question": "Why do indifference curves never cross?",
            "options": [
                "They represent complete preferences",
                "Each curve corresponds to a unique level of utility",
                "Utility functions are linear",
                "MRS is always constant"
            ],
            "correct_answer": "Each curve corresponds to a unique level of utility",
            "explanation": "Indifference curves never cross because each one represents a different level of utility, and crossing would imply contradictory preferences."
        },
        {
            "question": "What happens to the budget constraint line if the price of one good increases?",
            "options": [
                "The line shifts outward",
                "The slope decreases",
                "The line rotates inward",
                "The line remains unchanged"
            ],
            "correct_answer": "The line rotates inward",
            "explanation": "If the price of one good increases, the budget constraint line rotates inward, indicating the consumer can buy less of that good for the same income."
        },
        {
            "question": "How are normal goods characterized in terms of income elasticity?",
            "options": [
                "Income elasticity is negative",
                "Income elasticity is positive",
                "Income elasticity is zero",
                "Income elasticity is greater than one"
            ],
            "correct_answer": "Income elasticity is positive",
            "explanation": "Normal goods have a positive income elasticity of demand, meaning consumption increases as income increases."
        },
        {
            "question": "What term is used to describe a good with a positive own-price elasticity?",
            "options": [
                "Giffen good",
                "Normal good",
                "Inferior good",
                "Luxury good"
            ],
            "correct_answer": "Giffen good",
            "explanation": "A Giffen good has a positive own-price elasticity, meaning that an increase in its price can lead to an increase in the quantity demanded, often due to the dominance of the income effect over the substitution effect."
